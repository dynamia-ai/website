# Core Feature Deep-Dive

## AWS Neuron — Device- and **Core-Level** Sharing with Topology Awareness

AWS-designed **Inferentia** and **Trainium** accelerators aim to deliver more efficient and cost-controlled AI infrastructure on AWS. **Inferentia** targets inference acceleration, while **Trainium** targets training. These chips are purpose-built for AI workloads, focusing not only on raw performance but also on **performance-per-watt** and overall cost efficiency. **Inferentia2** brings notable gains in perf-per-watt, and **Trainium2** is stated to reduce costs by **30–40%** versus comparable GPU instances. HAMi now provides integrated support for these AWS accelerators—covering **scheduling**, **virtualization**, and **observability**.

**What HAMi adds for AWS Neuron**
 HAMi enables **fine-grained scheduling and sharing** of AWS **Trainium** and **Inferentia** accelerators in Kubernetes.

**Key capabilities**

1. **Core-level sharing.** A Neuron device typically exposes multiple  **NeuronCores** . HAMi allows users to request resources at the **single-NeuronCore** granularity instead of pinning an entire device, substantially improving utilization of high-value accelerators.
2. **Topology-aware placement.** For workloads that require multiple NeuronCores, the scheduler places them on  **low-latency core groupings** , maximizing intra-node communication efficiency.
3. **Simplified UX.** Users declare Neuron resources in Pod YAML—just like CPU/memory—by requesting `aws.amazon.com/neuron` (device) or `aws.amazon.com/neuroncore` (core). HAMi handles the underlying mapping.

**How topology awareness works**
HAMi’s topology-aware scheduling for AWS Neuron is based on **policy encoded from prior knowledge** of EC2 Neuron platforms rather than runtime topology discovery. Insights from AWS’s native scheduling logic for specific **EC2 Neuron instance types** are **codified** into HAMi’s internal rules.

**Implementation principles**

1. **Instance-type recognition.** The scheduler first reads the node’s **EC2 instance type** (e.g.,  **trn1** ,  **inf2** ) and uses it as the authoritative hint for the hardware topology.
2. **Linear abstraction.** All Neuron resources on a node are modeled as a **contiguous, zero-indexed list** (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, …]`), rather than a complex graph.
3. **Contiguous-block allocation (hard rule).** When a workload requests **N** devices/cores, the scheduler must find a **fully free, contiguous block of length N** within that list. If a node has enough free units but they are  **non-adjacent** , the placement  **fails** .

![Neuron device contiguous allocation visualization](/images/blog/hami-v2.7.0/1760022669789.png)

For Trainium instances, allocation is constrained to specific contiguous group sizes (e.g., 4/8/16) to align with the underlying high-bandwidth interconnect topology.

## NVIDIA GPU — **Topology-Aware Scheduling** (NVLink-First, Fragment-Aware)

This feature targets performance bottlenecks in **high-performance computing (HPC)** and **large-scale AI training**. When a job needs 2, 4, 8, or more GPUs, forcing those GPUs to communicate solely over the relatively slow **PCIe** bus makes data exchange the bottleneck and degrades end-to-end training throughput. By contrast, if the GPUs are placed on **NVLink-connected** sets, communication bandwidth increases dramatically, unlocking substantially higher overall performance.

### Topology Optimization: Design Rationale

We follow one core principle: prefer the best fit for the current job while preserving large, intact ***topology** *groups for future jobs** .

The mechanism has two stages: **Topology** **Registration** and  **Scheduling Decision** .

#### Stage 1: Topology Registration — Making the Physical Layout Visible

Goal: turn each node’s otherwise invisible physical GPU interconnects into standardized data that the cluster scheduler can reason about.

1. **Discovery.** On every GPU node, the **device plugin** uses NVIDIA **NVML** to obtain the pairwise physical link type between all GPUs—accurately distinguishing **NVLink** from standard **PCIe** links.
2. **Modeling.** The results are assembled into a clear **connectivity matrix** (an adjacency table) that records, for any two GPUs, whether they are connected via NVLink or PCIe. This matrix is the node’s digital blueprint of its GPU topology.
3. **Publication.** The matrix is serialized to **JSON** and attached to the node as an  **annotation** . From that point, the node’s physical topology is globally visible and queryable by the scheduler.

#### Stage 2: Scheduling Decision — Selecting the Optimal Placement

When a GPU-requesting workload arrives, the scheduler reconstructs each node’s connectivity matrix from annotations and performs a two-step decision process.

1. **Filter (eligibility gate).** The scheduler checks whether the node’s currently **free GPUs** contain one or more combinations that satisfy the request. For example, for a job that requires  **4 NVLink-connected GPUs** , the node must have  **at least one free 4-** **GPU NVLink** **set** . Nodes that cannot satisfy this hard constraint are discarded.
2. **Score (choose the best among eligibles).** Remaining nodes are scored to pick the best placement—maximizing the quality of the current fit while minimizing future **fragmentation** of high-bandwidth groups.

#### **Usage**

#### Concrete Policies

* **Multi-GPU jobs — “Best-fit” principle.**

Prefer **exact-size** NVLink groups. If a job needs 4 GPUs, a node with a  **free 4-** **GPU** **NVLink set** scores higher than a node that would  **carve 4 out of an 8-GPU NVLink group** . This avoids breaking large, valuable topology blocks and reduces fragmentation.

![Multi-GPU best-fit scheduling diagram showing exact-size NVLink group preference](/images/blog/hami-v2.7.0/1760023921307.png)

* **Single-GPU jobs — "Least-disruption" principle.**

Prefer **standalone** GPUs that are not members of any NVLink group. Only consume GPUs from within NVLink groups when no standalone options remain. This preserves intact high-bandwidth groups for workloads that truly need them.

![Single-GPU least-disruption scheduling diagram showing preference for standalone GPUs](/images/blog/hami-v2.7.0/1760023911556.png)

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-topology-aware-job
  annotations:
    hami.io/gpu-scheduler-policy: "topology-aware"
spec:
  containers:

# Scheduler Core Enhancements

## Extended **ResourceQuota** (multi-GPU memory/compute that actually adds up)

**Gaps in stock Kubernetes**

1. **No cross-resource linkage:** For `nvidia.com/gpu: 2` with `nvidia.com/gpumem: 2000` (MB **per** **GPU** ), stock ResourceQuota miscounts total memory as **2000MB** instead of  **2×2000MB** .
2. **No dynamic values:** Percent-based requests (e.g., `gpumem-percentage: 50`) can only be resolved **after** placement, when the actual device size is known.

**HAMi's approach**

* **Linked accounting:** Understands per-GPU semantics and computes the **true total** for quota enforcement.
* **Dynamic deduction:** Resolves percent-based/unspecified values **at scheduling time** based on the selected device.

![Extended ResourceQuota accounting diagram showing multi-GPU memory and compute calculation](/images/blog/hami-v2.7.0/1760023762746.png)

**Example**

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: gpu-quota
  namespace: default
spec:
  hard:
    limits.nvidia.com/gpu: "2"
    limits.nvidia.com/gpumem: "3000"
```

*Thanks to @FouoF.*

## Scheduling **Event Aggregation** (clear reasons, faster root-cause)

* Aggregates filter-stage failures into standardized tags (e.g., `CardInsufficientMemory`, `NumaNotFit`) with **counts** in `FilteringFailed` events.
* On success, **Normal** events include chosen nodes and scores; on failure, **Warning** events summarize why no nodes matched.
* Works with v4/v5 graded logs; see `docs/scheduler-event-log.md`.

# Application Ecosystem

HAMi not only advances low-level hardware support but also focuses on tight integration with the upper AI application stack to improve developer experience and operational efficiency.

## vLLM — Compatibility Enhancements

During Tensor Parallelism (TP), vLLM relies on the **NCCL** library for high-performance communication. Building on that, the latest HAMi-core brings the following improvements and fixes:

1. **Asynchronous memory request stabilization:** Fixed a bug where async allocations could occasionally exceed the **MemPool** ceiling, improving memory-management stability.
2. **Memory accounting accuracy:** Corrected cases where **`cuMemCreate`** partial allocations were not fully attributed, ensuring more accurate memory usage reporting.
3. **Symbol resolution fix:** Resolved intermittent symbol reference issues that could lead to process  **hangs** , increasing system robustness.
4. **Context management fix:** Corrected context-size accounting when contexts are recreated, preventing potential errors caused by size mismatches.

 In addition, the vLLM community has merged [[PR #579: Feat - Add Support HAMi Resources Variables]](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/pull/579) enabling **native HAMi support** in vLLM. This allows users to configure resources directly via HAMi's virtualization and scheduling layer, reducing integration overhead while improving compatibility and ease of use.

## Xinference

**Xinference** is an open-source multi-model inference framework from Xorbits. It adopts a **Supervisor/Worker** architecture that simplifies deploying and managing multi-model services on Kubernetes.

In enterprise practice, Xinference often encounters: (a)  **small models monopolizing full GPUs** , leading to waste; and (b) **limited quota/observability** for multi-tenant scenarios.

To address this, the community merged **[PR #6]**, adding **native HAMi vGPU support** in the Helm chart. With a simple flag, users can enable HAMi and propagate resource variables such as `gpucores` and `gpumem-percentage` through to both Supervisor and Worker.

![Xinference Helm chart integration with HAMi vGPU support](/images/blog/hami-v2.7.0/1760022774131.png)

**Outcomes**

* Small models can **safely share** GPUs, resulting in  **significantly higher overall utilization** .
* **Deployment is simpler** : no custom glue code—HAMi virtualization works out-of-the-box.
* **Quota & observability ready** for multi-user, multi-job concurrency in production.

## Volcano Dynamic MIG

Volcano’s GPU virtualization supports requesting **partial GPU resources** (memory/compute) and, together with the Device Plugin, enforces **hardware isolation** to improve utilization. Traditional GPU virtualization typically intercepts CUDA API calls to limit usage. With NVIDIA Ampere, **MIG** (  **Multi-Instance GPU** **)** allows a single physical GPU to be partitioned into multiple isolated instances; however, generic MIG schemes often rely on  **pre-fixed instance sizes** , which can introduce waste and reduce flexibility.

**Volcano v1.12** introduces **dynamic MIG creation and scheduling**. It selects MIG instance sizes **at runtime** based on requested GPU usage and applies a **best-fit** strategy to reduce waste. It also supports **binpack** and **spread** scoring to control fragmentation and boost utilization. Users request resources via a **unified API** (`volcano.sh/vgpu-number`, `…/vgpu-cores`, `…/vgpu-memory`) without worrying about the underlying implementation.
